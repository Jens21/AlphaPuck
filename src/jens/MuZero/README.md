# Neural Network Training and Evaluation
Welcome to the repository for our neural network project! This repository contains the code and resources necessary to train and evaluate our neural network model.

Getting Started
To begin the training process, execute the main_training.py script. This script initiates the training procedure for our neural network using the provided dataset. You can customize various parameters and settings within the script to tailor the training process to your needs.

Evaluating the Network
Once you have trained the neural network model or if you have a pre-trained model, you can evaluate its performance using the main_evaluation.py script. This script runs the trained model on a separate evaluation dataset and provides insights into its accuracy, performance metrics, and more.

Checkpoint Management
During training, the model's progress is periodically saved to ensure that you can resume training or perform evaluations without starting from scratch. Checkpoints of the model and associated training information are saved in the checkpoints directory. This allows you to easily manage and load specific points in the training process.

Feel free to explore the scripts and adapt them to your needs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy training and evaluating!

# Neural Network Training and Evaluation
Welcome to the part of our MuZero agent! This directory contains the code and resources necessary to train and evaluate the MuZero agent.

**Getting Started**
To begin the training process, execute the main_training.py script. This script initiates the training procedure for our neural network. You can customize various parameters and settings within the script to tailor the training process to your needs.

**Evaluating the Network**
Once you have trained the neural network model or if you have a pre-trained model, you can evaluate its performance using the main_evaluation.py script. This script runs the trained model and evaluates them on 200 seeds.

**Checkpoint Management**
During training, the model's progress is periodically saved to ensure that you can resume training or perform evaluations without starting from scratch. Checkpoints of the model and associated training information are saved in the checkpoints directory. This allows you to easily manage and load specific points in the training process.

Feel free to explore the scripts and adapt them to your needs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy training and evaluating!
